# KNearestNeighborsCLASSIFIER

K-Nearest Neighbors is one of the most basic yet essential classification algorithms in Machine Learning. 
It belongs to the supervised learning domain and finds intense application in pattern recognition, data mining and intrusion detection. 
The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, easy-to-implement supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used to solve 
both classification and regression problems. The KNN algorithm assumes that similar things exist in close proximity. In other words, 
similar things are near to each other. KNN captures the idea of similarity (sometimes called distance, proximity, or closeness) with 
some mathematics we might have learned in our childhoodâ€” calculating the distance between points on a graph. There are other ways of calculating distance,
and one way might be preferable depending on the problem we are solving. However, the straight-line distance (also called the Euclidean distance) 
is a popular and familiar choice. It is widely disposable in real-life scenarios since it is non-parametric, meaning, it does not make any underlying 
assumptions about the distribution of data (as opposed to other algorithms such as GMM, which assume a Gaussian distribution of the given data).
